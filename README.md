# Localizer: A solver for the point realizability problem

The 'realizability problem' is a well-known hard problem in computational geometry, consisting of receiving a set of constraints on the relative positions of points in the plane and determining whether there exists a configuration of points in general position that satisfies all the constraints. **Localizer** is a local-search solver for this problem. In particular, **Localizer** receives a set of constraints of the form `A_(i, j, k)`, or `B_(i, j, k)`, where `A_(i, j, k)` means that point `i` is above the directed line from point `j` to point `k`, and `B_(i, j, k)` means that point `i` is below the directed line from point `j` to point `k`. Equivalently, `A_(i, j, k)` is equivalent to Knuth's CC relation (see https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-55611-7). Formally,
`A_(i, j, k)` imposes a constraint on points $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$, $p_j = (x_j, y_j)$, and $p_k = (x_k, y_k)$ equivalent to:
$$
\det \begin{pmatrix}
x_i & x_j & x_k \\
y_i & y_j & y_k \\ 1 & 1 & 1 
\end{pmatrix} > 0,
$$
and `B_(i, j, k)` states that the determinant is strictly less than zero.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the executable
cd src
make

# Run with an orientation file
./localizer ../path/to/orientation_file.or

# Plot the solution
cd ..
python3 scripts/plotter.py --sol output.txt
```

## Building

```bash
# Navigate to source directory
cd src

# Standard build (optimized)
make

# Debug build
make debug

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Usage

```bash
./localizer <orientation_file> [-i <sub_iterations>] [-d <min_dist>] [-o <output_file>] [-s <seed>] [-r <reset_interval>] [-t <threads>] [-f <fixed_points_file>] [-c <symmetry_file>]
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `-i`   | Sub-iterations | 10 |
| `-d`   | Minimum distance between points | 0.25 |
| `-o`   | Output file path | output.txt |
| `-s`   | Random seed | 42 |
| `-r`   | Reset interval | N/A |
| `-t`   | Number of threads | N/A |
| `-f`   | Fixed points file | N/A |
| `-c`   | Symmetry file | N/A |

## Input Format

The orientation file must follow these rules:

1. Each line contains an "orientation" in the format `<O>(<a>, <b>, <c>)`.
2. `<O>` must be either "A" (above), "B" (below), or "C" (collinear).
3. The parameters `<a>`, `<b>`, `<c>` are positive integers where `a < b < c`.

For example, `A(2, 4, 7)` means point `2` is above the directed line from point `4` to point `7`.



## Visualization

Plot a solution generated by the localizer:

```bash
python3 scripts/plotter.py --sol <output_file>
```

This creates `<output_file>.png` with a visualization of the point set.

## Validation

Validate a solution against constraints:

```bash
python3 scripts/validator.py -c <constraint_file> -p <point_file>
```

## Running Benchmarks

Execute the benchmark suite:

```bash
python3 scripts/eval_benchmarks.py [-b] [-L <lower_N>] [-R <upper_N>] [-n <iterations>] [-t <timeout>]
```
