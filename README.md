# Point realizer

Code for realizability of pseudo-points (through CC-systems / signotopes / triple orientations).

## Compilation

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./realizer <orientation file> [-i <sub iterations (int)>] [-d <minimum distance (float)>] [-o <output file>] [-s <random seed(int)>]
```

The default values are:

```text
-i := 10
-d := 0.25
-o := output.txt
-s := 42
```

The orientation file must be in the format described by the following rules:

1. Each line contains an “orientation”, which must be in the format `<O>(<a>, <b>, <c>)`.
2. `<O>` must be either “A” (above), “B” (below), or “C” (collinear).
3. The parameters`<a>`, `<b>`, `<c>` are positive integers that hold `a < b < c`.

For example, a valid orientation is `A(2, 4, 7)` and represents that point `2` is above the directed line `4 -> 7`.

To facilitate things, this repo includes a file that translates SAT assignments into this format.
It requires the encoding to index the variable representing whether point `a` is above `b->c` (or equivalently, that `a->b->c` is a counterclockwise turn) as:

```text
index(a, b, c) := a  + ((b-2)*(b-1))/2 + ((c-3)*(c-2)*(c-1))/6
```

To use this translator, simply run

```bash
python3 to_real_format.py <sat_solution_file>
```

This will generate `<sat_solution_file>.or` with the desired format.

## Plotting Solutions

A solution generated by the `realizer` (e.g., `output.txt`) can be plotted by running:

```bash
python3 plotter.py --sol <output file from realizer>
```

As a result, `<output file from realizer>.png` will be generated with the desired plot.
